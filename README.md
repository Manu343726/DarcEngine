# DarcEngine
A cross-platform video game engine that I do because I want to learn more about it.

# Usage
If you want to execute the engine with the sample applications you must to 
do the follow steps.

## Windows - Visual Studio 12
Important!!!
You must to execute the following executables with the Developer Command Prompt for VS2013. If not it won't work properly.

In "DarcEngine\dependencies\DarcEngine" directory:
	<code> ./wbuild.bat </code>
And finally in "DarcEngine"
	<code> ./wbuild.bat </code>

If you want to clean the build you cand do it with the <code> wclean.bat </code> command.

## Linux - GCC
In "DarcEngine\dependencies\DarcEngine" directory:
	<code> sh lbuild.sh </code>
And finally in "DarcEngine"
	<code> sh lbuild.sh </code>

If you want to clean the build you cand do it with the <code> sh lclean.sh </code> command.

## OS X - XCode
In "DarcEngine\dependencies\DarcEngine" directory:
	<code> sh mbuild.sh </code>
And finally in "DarcEngine"
	<code> sh mbuild.sh </code>

I think that is very easy to use by now, I hope that in the future will be easier tha now :).
